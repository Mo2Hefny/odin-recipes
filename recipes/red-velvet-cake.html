  <h1>Red Velvet Cake</h1>
  <img src="../images/red-velvet-cake.jpeg" alt="Red velvet cake image">
  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>You may have heard it said that red velvet cake is just chocolate cake with the addition of red food coloring, but
    that is actually not the case. The cake's classic red hue actually came as a by-product of the combination of
    ingredients used to create its signature "velvety" texture. Let's look at the layered history of this iconic cake.
